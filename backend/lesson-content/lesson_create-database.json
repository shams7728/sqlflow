            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "2. Why use it?\nEvery application that stores data needs a database. This is the very first command you would run when setting up a new project. It prepares the space where all your application's data will live."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "3. How does it work?\nWhen you execute `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`, the database management system (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server) allocates disk space and creates the necessary system files to manage the new database. You only need to provide a unique name for it."
