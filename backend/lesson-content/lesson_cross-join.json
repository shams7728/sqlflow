            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "2. Why use a CROSS JOIN?\nIt's used in specific scenarios where you need to generate all possible combinations of items between two sets of data. For example, creating a master list of all possible T-shirt variations by combining every available size with every available color."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "3. How does it work?\nIf the first table has 'N' rows and the second table has 'M' rows, the CROSS JOIN will produce a result set with N * M rows. It simply pairs every row from the first table with every row from the second."
        },

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "4. What is the syntax?\nThe explicit syntax is `SELECT ... FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;`. An older, implicit syntax is `SELECT ... FROM table1, table2;`, but using the `CROSS JOIN` keyword is clearer and recommended."
