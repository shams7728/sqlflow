Please provide a list showing the total number of orders, total revenue, and average order value for each category. To keep the report focused, only include categories that have generated more than $20,000 in total revenue. Please sort the final list by the highest revenue first.'"

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "3. Step-by-Step Solution Logic\nTo build the final query, we must think in logical steps:\n- **Step A: Calculate Revenue per Order Item:** The `orders` table doesn't have a total amount. First, we must calculate it for each row (`quantity * price_per_unit`).\n- **Step B: Link Orders to Categories:** To analyze by category, we must connect the orders to their product information. This requires an `INNER JOIN` between `orders` and `products` on `product_id`.\n- **Step C: Group the Data:** The request asks for metrics 'for each category'. This is a clear signal that we need to use `GROUP BY p.category`.\n- **Step D: Calculate Aggregates:** For each group, we need to calculate three things: `COUNT(o.order_id)` for the number of orders, `SUM(o.quantity * o.price_per_unit)` for total revenue, and `AVG(o.quantity * o.price_per_unit)` for the average order value.\n- **Step E: Filter the Groups:** The request specifies 'categories with more than $20,000 in revenue'. Since this is a filter on an aggregate result (`SUM`), we must use the `HAVING` clause.\n- **Step F: Sort the Final Result:** Finally, the report must be sorted by the highest revenue first, which requires an `ORDER BY total_revenue DESC`."
