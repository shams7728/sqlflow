            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "2. Why use a VIEW?\nViews are used for several reasons: to simplify complex queries involving multiple joins; to provide a consistent, abstract interface to users even if the underlying tables change; and to implement security by restricting access to specific columns or rows."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "3. How does it work?\nWhen you create a view, the database stores the `SELECT` statement. Each time you run a query against the view, the database executes the stored `SELECT` statement in the background to produce the results."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "4. What is the syntax?\nThe basic syntax is `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;`. After a view is created, you can query it just like a regular table: `SELECT * FROM view_name;`."
