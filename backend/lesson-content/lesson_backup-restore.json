What are the main types of backups?\nThere are two main categories: **Physical backups** copy the actual data files, making for a very fast restore. **Logical backups** export the data into a file (like a `.sql` script containing `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements), which is more flexible but slower to restore."

What are Full, Differential, and Incremental Backups?\n- **Full Backup:** A complete copy of the entire database. \n- **Differential Backup:** Copies only the data that has changed since the last *full* backup. \n- **Incremental Backup:** Copies only the data that has changed since the last backup of *any* type (full or incremental)."

It includes details like the location of backups, the order of restoration (e.g., restore the last full backup, then all subsequent differential backups), and who is responsible. A backup is useless without a tested recovery plan."
